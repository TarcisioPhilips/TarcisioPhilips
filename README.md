Passionate about solving problems and helping people. Despite technicalities and tech preferences, my main focus is delivering and adding value to the product. I believe it is crucial to be able to pivot and adjust to changing priorities and market demands.
Former teacher and musician, in my free time I write blog posts, code, and talk about career in technology and software development
