## TarcÃ­sio Philips

Passionate about solving problems and helping people. Despite technicalities and tech preferences, my main focus is delivering and adding value to the product.
Former teacher and musician, in my free time I write blog posts, code, and talk about career in technology and software development.

"Talk is cheap. Show me the code"
